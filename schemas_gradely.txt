LUPER COMMENTS


1. for the student model, i suggest we remove the student class from STUDNET MODEL field and create a new model called "STUDENT_CLASS" this will allow students to have history of their classes,based on promotion or otherwise

*** STUDENT_CLASS
    id: INT (PK)
    class_id: INT(FK [CLASS])
    student_id: INT(FK [STUDENT])
    session_id: INT(FK [SESSION])
    date_added: DATE


*** CLASS_SUBJECTS
//Model used to add subjects to a class

*** CLASS_TEACHER
//Model used to add teachers to a class , they will perform actions as a class teacher, may be we can add role as class_teacher

*** SUBJECT_TEACHER
//Model used to add teachers to a subjecct , they will perform actions as a subject teacher, may be we can add role as subject_teacher

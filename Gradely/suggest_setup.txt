## Suggestions for the First Tasks
1. I suggest that we need to do the basic set up  first;
    a. App Installing and activation
    b. urls patterns
    c. Bootstrap Admin Template integration
2. Database Design then others.

3. Recall we did not include Examinations computation in App Requirement Proposed 
to form part of the first version, but I am seeing Examinations computation
forming the basics of the first version. I suggest we follow our initial proposed 
App requirement doc unless there is a change in our first version of the software.
